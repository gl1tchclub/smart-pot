Irrigation App
--------------

Version 1:
 - Measures the soil moisture for any given plant and, based on a threshold, determines if the plant needs watering
 - Photoresistor used to detect light level OR humidity sensor
 - Light turns on to let plant owner know that it needs watering/environment change
 - LCD screen displays moisture and environment, if it's dispensing water, ON/OFF, and plant name
 - Watchdog timer and FSM

Version 2:
 - A pump dispenses water based on the threshold
 - Buttons for user interation/changing info displayed on screen/on and off

Version 3:
 - App that sends and receives plant data
 - Arduinos sending/receiving plant info/commands based on plant info from plantapi
 - Dispensing water based on received command/info

Version 4 (USB Serial communication):
 - 3D Printed arduino case that allows for clipping on and a pot
 
 
Watchdog:
Environmental Factors: 
In harsh environments where the system may be exposed to extreme temperatures, radiation, or other adverse conditions, 
a watchdog timer can help maintain system stability by resetting the system if it malfunctions due to environmental factors.


 
Things to think about:
----------------------
	Pump water into a section of the pot or try 'bottom watering' which could be easier?
