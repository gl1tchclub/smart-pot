Started by wiring an LED strip to see how it works.
Then, added a button that turns it on/off using an FSM.
	- Decided to use FSM as it'll be more flexible than an interrupt when I add more buttons/hardware
	- had trouble with the FSM for 1 button doing more than one thing

Once that was working, wired a LCD I2C component and printed a basic string
	- ez

Then, added the screen turning on/off with the same button press
	- Coding this was pretty simple now that the FSM had already been set up with the same button
	- Mostly just moving FSM code into separate transition methods and making a transition for the screen
	- Displayed simple message like turning off/on and welcome to smart pot when on

Since I hadn't received parts at the start of week 14 when I was working on the minimum scope, I decided to work with
adding sensors that I had on me that could be included in the scope. I decided a humidity and temp sensor would be perfect.
	- Never worked with the DHT11 before this, so this was a first time experience
	- Was a little difficult finding a source with working information, but I found it in the end
	- The wiring for my DHT11 was different to sources online, which made calculations fail
	- Created a method, implemented it in FSM, and it worked.

Wanted to fix the flickering of the temp display
	- I wanted the temp info to be updated and redisplayed when updated, so I delayed for 1 second
	- This caused flickering, so I decided to only redisplay after 5 seconds and only when temp or humidity had changed
	- This took a while to implement as trying to calculate when 5 seconds had passed since the last time was messy
	
Week 14 - parts received. First, connect longer LED strip. Then, connect soil moisture sensor and display soil moisture data. Lastly, connect another
button for displaying different data
Discussed potentially using 2 wires in water as a water level sensor w Vsaughn
	- I connected the moisture sensor and 2 more buttons with ease
